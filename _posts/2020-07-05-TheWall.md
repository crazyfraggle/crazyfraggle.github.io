It's said that everyone at some point get 15 minutes of fame. Mine did last a
bit longer. It's time to rewind all the way back to 1995.

Word of warning: My memory isn't all that good, so some details might be
slightly off.

## Winter 1995

Recently we'd discovered this fancy new thing called the World Wide Web. We'd
all been on the internet since we started at [UiT.no](https://uit.no/) in August
1994, but between various Usenet and FTP sites it wasn't all that exciting.
Until someone installed the
[Mosaic web browser](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)>) on
our university machines.

All of a sudden there was a lot of information available, and some entertaining
pages. Hours were lost browsing the Yahoo web index. We also got the ability to
create our own web pages on our university Unix accounts. So we did.

Pages and documents could be created using this new fancy `HTML` mark up. These
were personal pages where we presented ourselves, showcased projects and
maintained our "Hotlists" -- pages with links to other pages we'd discovered and
found interesting.

## The Wall

We were not allowed to run server side scripts, and modern things like client
side image maps did not exist at the time. Styling of page items was also not
defined in HTML at the time (there was no such thing as CSS) so all images had
an implicit border. I got the idea that this side effect could be used as an
effect on it's own, and created a front page consisting entirely of images, laid
out in a brick wall like fashion. Nicely decorated using the spray can effect in
Paint. High class.

The effect was something like this (thank you
[Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/)):

<div style="text-align: center; line-height: 1px">
<img src="https://placekitten.com/g/200/100" style="border: 2px solid purple"><img src="https://placekitten.com/g/200/100" style="border: 2px solid purple">

## Going out to the world

Of course no one but ourselves were visiting these pages, so one late afternoon
in March we decided to list our pages on the Yahoo web index, and see who got
the most traffic. I think this was a thursday or friday.

## Next monday

When I arrived at the university the next monday, I got a stern notice that I
needed to go visit TK (Teknisk Kompetansegruppe), the sysadmins for the CS
department. There I was met by the approximate question "What have you done?"

Over the weekend, traffic to the page had spiked to the point where it almost
took down the web server. Thankfully, TK had recently transitioned to the new
patched `httpd` variant named `Apache` which was capable of handling the
traffic. They also directed responses to my page to a dedicated machine, and we
could literally watch the traffic log flow quickly in a terminal.

## Netscape

It turned out that most of the traffic was coming from this new browser called
[Netscape](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_(web_browser)>). We didn't
really know this browser, as we did not have access to it on our machines.
Netscape had a set of standard menu items, "What's new" and "What's cool" menus.
These were curated with pages someone in Netscape found interesting, and that
someone had apparently picked up my fancy hack and found it interesting enough
to list there.

The result was a traffic volume that would spike my page to a level that the
largest norwegian online newspaper ([VG](https://vg.no)) would not reach until
more than a year later. IIRC there were >1M requests during that week alone, and
the traffic stayed high for a long time after that. Granted, one reason for the
high amount of requests, was that the images on the page caused some (15?)
additional requests after the initial HTML.

There were also complaints that links going out from my hotlist would take down
servers on other universities, causing a
[Slashdot effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect) two and a half
years before [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/) was founded.

## The HTML files

There was one section on The Wall that contained some actual content: **The HTML
files**. This was a collection of various text files that I'd found around the
internet and BBSes, and converted into this new fancy HTML format, including a
complete version of the Devil's Dictionary. I've found an old backup, and you
can now find [The HTML files](/static/html/Docs/index.html) here.

I've left out the Devil's Dictionary this time though, as there are several
entries that will be considered sexist or plain racist. Even though the
intention from the author even back around 1900 probably was to provoke, I don't
feel the need to fuel it further.

I haven't massaged the rest of the files either, which means among other things
that there has been some sort of encoding glitch on the scandinavian texts.
