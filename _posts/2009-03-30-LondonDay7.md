On monday I went out on my own again, since Alison had to work. I first set
course for the [Forbidden Planet](http://www.forbiddenplanet.co.uk/) again. This
time they were open. Browsed through the store but found nothing that I wanted,
so I left without getting anything. More money not spent.

Since the weather was lovely though, I decided to go to Hyde Park and just relax
a little, and finally write some post cards. Really wished I had my roller
blades with me there. The road through the middle of the park seemed wonderful
for blading, and there were quite a few people doing so there. But this being
London, the weather clouded over again, and sitting in the park soon became too
cold. So I left by the Marble Arch gate in the north east of the park and went
looking for a pint.

After having a pint at Tudor Rose I started wandering back to Leicester square
to meet with Alison. This took some time, since I really like just wandering
through the various small back alley streets just looking around. Finally ended
up at the Bear and Staff just by Leicester square to wait for Alison. We stayed
there for dinner as well, before taking an evening walk along the south bank of
the river, stopping for another pint here and there.
