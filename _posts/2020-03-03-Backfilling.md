In order to consolidate my blogging in a single source, I'm backfilling my old
blog from [Blogger](https://blog.crazyfraggle.com/), and will eventually
redirect that here.

This might be considered a cheap way to get content here, but that's fine. :)

Much of these posts are severely outdated, but for historical reasons it's
interesting to keep here. I'm leaving the original texts as they were, apart
from some typos I just cannot let live. Some reformatting to fit this blogs
publishing system is necessary though.
