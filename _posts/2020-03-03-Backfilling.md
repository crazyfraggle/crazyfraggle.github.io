In order to consolidate my blogging in a single source, I'm backfilling my old
blog from [Blogger](https://blog.crazyfraggle.com/), and will eventually
redirect that here.

This might be considered a cheap way to get content here, but that's fine. :)

Much of these posts are severely outdated, but for historical reasons it's
interesting to keep. I'm leaving the original texts as they were, apart from
some typos I just cannot let live. Some reformatting to fit this blogs
publishing system is necessary though. Pictures alas are reduced to their
previews. URLs are directed to [Archive.org](https:///web.archive.org/) where
the original no longer exist.

Looking back, it's obvious I don't have the most reliable output on the blog.
