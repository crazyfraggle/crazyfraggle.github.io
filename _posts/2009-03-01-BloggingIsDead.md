I've finally started a blog. That should officially end the age of blogging.

I'm going to use this blog for commenting about the things happening on my end
of the planet. This might and might not interest the rest of the planet, but
that's beside the point. Topics will include software projects I'm working on,
tips for tools I'm using, football related stuff, gaming and generic stuff. I
don't expect to have a steady schedule for posting though, so if you for some
reason plans to follow my rants, you better just subscribe it in your favourite
feed reader.

Also note that the blog will probably be bilingual. Most of the stuff regarding
computers and games will be in english, but football and generic stuff about
Troms√∏ will probably be written in norwegian.
