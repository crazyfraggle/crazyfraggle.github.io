Even though I was on a budget, I realized that I had to go back to Camden Town
again. When we were there on wednesday quite a few stalls were closing already.
First though we went out for a late breakfast. Alison knew a place down in
Bethnal Green called
"[Pellicci](http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/Pelliccifeature.htm)". Wonderful place
with an atmosphere that put a smile on my face for the rest of the day.

From Bethnal Green we went down to Leicester Sq to get tickets for the evening's
performance of Les Miserables. Got some rather cheap tickets out on the side of
the upper gallery. Since we were using a double decker to get around this time,
I got to snap a few pics in traffic as well.

Back in Camden I ended up with only a few t-shirts and a new
trolley-backpack-bag to stuff things in for the return trip. Though this was
mostly through strict "don't buy stuff you don't really need" attitude on my
part.

In the evening we went back downtown for Les Miserables. As you can see from the
pic on the left, the theater is a lot higher than deep, so we ended up watching
from above. But the play is still good. And the theater completely full, but
mostly tourists though.
