![Bridge](/static/images/backfill/london/P1030697.jpg)Since I booked my Qantas
flights to Brisbane back in 2006 through British Airways, they keep sending me
<span style="text-decoration: line-through">spam</span>emails with offers and
stuff to do at various destinations. Because of this I was aware that this
sunday was the date of the annual Cambridge vs. Oxford boat race. Known simply
as [The Boat Race](http://www.theboatrace.org/). Alison needed to do some work,
so I set out on my own down to Hammersmith.

![Crowd](/static/images/backfill/london/P1030712.jpg)Arriving at Hammersmith
station I realized I wasn't quite prepared for the amount of people that show up
for this event. I think this is the only time I've ever seen people queue up for
a zebra crossing. According to the TV coverage, a quarter of a million people
were gathered along the banks for the race. So even though I arrived a good hour
before the event, it was clear that I was at least an hour late already.
![Boat](/static/images/backfill/london/P1030710_cropped.jpg)I caught a bit of
the warm-up race 45 minutes before the main event, and then went to see if I
could find a better spot. I didn't so I ended up in Furnival Gardens where there
was a big screen set up. And lots of people. So I watched the main race from
there.

![Text particle collider](/static/images/backfill/london/P1030718.jpg)After the
race I decided to go to Kensington to visit the Science Museum. Arriving half an
hour before closing time, so I didn't really have the time to visit any of the
most interesting exhibitions, such as the new
[Cracking Ideas](http://www.crackingideas.com/) exhibit and the IMAX theatre.
The pictures show a large circle in the center that I think was supposed to
simulate the Large Hadron Collider and occasionally merged the particles into
texts.

From the Science Museum I went to look for the Forbidden Planet Megastore.
Finally found it after walking along most of the Shaftesbury Avenu - should have
taken the tube stop further - and realized it had closed 15 minutes before. So I
went looking for a pub and a pint, before going back to Alison's place.
