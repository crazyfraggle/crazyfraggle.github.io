![Gun](/static/images/backfill/london/P1030666.jpg)Thursday we decided to follow
Kjella's advice and went to the Imperial War Museum. Some interesting stuff to
see there, in particular old WW1 and WW2 fighter planes. The exhibition on The
Secret War, with spies and stuff was quite interesting as well. From there we
moved on to the holocaust exhibition which was generally so depressing we
decided to leave after that. Thus skipping the exhibition on crimes against
humanity. I'm still quite amazed at what human beings are capable of doing to
one another. ![Plane](/static/images/backfill/london/P1030668.jpg)

![Tunnel](/static/images/backfill/london/P1030669.jpg)In the evening it was time
for the first gig of the trip, a 4-band setup at Hoxton Bar & Kitchen. I rather
liked the venue, with a rather large stage room in the back and two bars up
front. The bands were mostly disappointing though, so we ended up listening to a
couple of tunes from each before going out to the main bar to wait for the next
band to come on.
