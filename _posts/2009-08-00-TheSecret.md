Some claim that I look too young for my age. Which is nice. Really. I feel a lot
younger than I am as well, so that fits. But why is that?

I think I've figured it out. By old reckoning, one counted age in how many
summers one has seen. And for my part, that would currently be 33 summers. Hmm,
34 soon actually. But 15 of those summers are here in Tromsø. And it is common
knowledge that the summers here are short. I think it is fair to say that the
summer here is about a third of a "proper summer".

So, by that logic, I've now seen 19+15/3 = 24 summers. :)

So if you want to stay young? Move to Tromsø.
