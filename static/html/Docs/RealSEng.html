    <h1 align="center">Real Software Engineers Don't Read Dumps</h1>

    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers don't read dumps. They never generate them, and on
      the rare occasions that they come across them, they are vaguely amused.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers don't comment their code. The identifiers are so
      mnemonic they don't have to.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers don't write applications programs, they implement
      algorithms. If someone has an application that the algorithm might help
      with, that's nice. Don't ask them to write the user interface, though.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers eat quiche.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      If it doesn't have recursive function calls, real software engineers don't
      program in it. Real software engineers don't program in assembler. They
      become queasy at the very thought.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers don't debug programs, they verify correctness.
      This process doesn't necessarily involve executing anything on a computer,
      except perhaps a Correctness Verification Aid package.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers like C's structured constructs, but they are
      suspicious of it because they have heard that it lets you get "close to
      the machine."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers play tennis. In general, they don't like any sport
      that involves getting hot and sweaty and gross when out of range of a
      shower. (Thus mountain climbing is Right Out.) They will occasionally wear
      their tennis togs to work, but only on very sunny days.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers admire PASCAL for its discipline and Spartan
      purity, but they find it difficult to actually program in. They don't tell
      this to their friends, because they are afraid it means that they are
      somehow Unworthy.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers work from 9 to 5, because that is the way the job
      is described in the formal spec. Working late would feel like using an
      undocumented external procedure.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers write in languages that have not actually been
      implemented for any machine, and for which only the formal spec (in BNF)
      is available. This keeps them from having to take any machine dependencies
      into account. Machine dependencies make real software engineers very
      uneasy.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers don't write in ADA, because the standards bodies
      have not quite decided on a formal spec yet.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers like writing their own compilers, preferably in
      PROLOG (they also like writing them in unimplemented languages, but it
      turns out to be difficult to actually RUN these).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers regret the existence of COBOL, FORTRAN and BASIC.
      PL/1 is getting there, but it is not nearly disciplined enough; far too
      much built in function.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers aren't too happy about the existence of users,
      either. Users always seem to have the wrong idea about what the
      implementation and verification of algorithms is all about.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers don't like the idea of some inexplicable and
      greasy hardware several aisles away that may stop working at any moment.
      They have a great distrust of hardware people, and wish that systems could
      be virtual at ALL levels. They would like personal computers (you know no
      one's going to trip over something and kill your DFA in mid-transit),
      except that they need 8 megabytes to run their Correctness Verification
      Aid packages.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Real software engineers think better while playing WFF 'N' PROOF.
