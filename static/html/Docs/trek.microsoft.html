<h2>"Star Trek Lost Episodes" transcript.</h2>

<strong>Picard</strong> "Mr. LaForge, have you had any success with
your attempts at finding a weakness in the Borg? And Mr. Data, have
you been able to access their command pathways?"
<p>


<strong>Geordi</strong> "Yes, Captain. In fact, we found the answer by
searching through our archives on late Twentieth-century computing
technology."
<p>


<em>Geordi presses a key, and a logo appears on the computer screen.</em>
<p>


<strong>Riker looks puzzled.</strong> "What the hell is `<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>'?" <p>


<strong>Data turns to answer.</strong> "Allow me to explain. We will
send this program, for some reason called `Windows', through the Borg
command pathways. Once inside their root command unit, it will begin
consuming system resources at an unstoppable rate."
<p>


<strong>Picard</strong> "But the Borg have the ability to adapt. Won't
they alter their processing systems to increase their storage
capacity?"
<p>


<strong>Data</strong> "Yes, Captain. But when `Windows' detects this,
it creates a new version of itself known as an `upgrade'. The use of
resources increases exponentially with each iteration. The Borg will
not be able to adapt quickly enough. Eventually all of their
processing ability will be taken over and none will be available for
their normal operational functions."
<p>


<strong>Picard</strong> "Excellent work. This is even better than that
`unsolvable geometric shape' idea."
<p>


<em>. . . 15 Minutes Later . . .</em>
<p>


<strong>Data</strong> "Captain, we have successfully installed the
`Windows' in the Borg's command unit. As expected, it immediately
consumed 85% of all available resources. However, we have not received
any confirmation of the expected `upgrade'."
<p>


<strong>Geordi</strong> "Our scanners have picked up an increase in
Borg storage and CPU capacity, but we still have no indication of an
`upgrade' to compensate for their increase."
<p>


<strong>Picard</strong> "Data, scan the history banks again and
determine if there is something we have missed."
<p>


<strong>Data</strong> "Sir, I believe there is a reason for the
failure in the `upgrade'.  Appearently the Borg have circumvented that
part of the plan by not sending in their registration cards."
<p>


<strong>Riker</strong> "Captain, we have no choice. Requesting
permission to begin emergency escape sequence 3F ...."
<p>


<strong>Geordi, excited</strong> "Wait, Captain! Their CPU capacity
has suddenly dropped to 0% !"
<p>


<strong>Picard</strong> "Data, what do your scanners show?"
<p>


<strong>Data, studying displays</strong> "Appearently the Borg have
found the internal `Windows' module named `Solitaire', and it has used
up all available CPU capacity."
<p>


<strong>Picard</strong> "Let's wait and see how long this `Solitaire'
can reduce their functionality."
<p>


<em>. . . Two Hours Pass . . .</em>
<p>


<strong>Riker</strong> "Geordi, what is the status of the Borg?"
<p>


<strong>Geordi</strong> "As expected, the Borg are attempting to
re-engineer to compensate for increased CPU and storage demands, but
each time they successfully increase resources I have setup our
closest deep space monitor beacon to transmit more `Windows' modules
from something called the `Microsoft Fun-pack'.
<p>


<strong>Picard</strong> "How much time will that buy us?"
<p>


<strong>Data</strong> "Current Borg solution rates allow me to
predicate an interest time span of 6 more hours."
<p>


<strong>Geordi</strong> "Captain, another vessel has entered our
sector."
<p>


<strong>Picard</strong> "Identify."
<p>


<strong>Data</strong> "It appears to have markings very similar to the
'Microsoft' logo..."
<p>


<strong>Over the speakers</strong> "THIS IS ADMIRAL BILL GATES OF THE
MICROSOFT FLAGSHIP <em>MONOPOLY</em>. WE HAVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF
UNREGISTERED SOFTWARE IN THIS SECTOR. SURRENDER ALL ASSETS AND WE CAN
AVOID ANY TROUBLE. YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS TO COMPLY."
<p>


<strong>Data</strong> "The alien ship has just opened its forward
hatches and released thousands of humanoid-shaped objects."
<p>


<strong>Picard</strong> "Magnify forward viewer on the alien craft!"
<p>


<strong>Riker</strong> "My God, captain! Those are human beings
floating straight toward the Borg ship - with no life support suits!
How can they survive the tortures of deep space?!"
<p>


<strong>Data</strong> "I don't believe that those are humans, sir. If
you will look closer I believe you will see that they are carrying
something recognized by twenty-first century man as doeskin leather
briefcases, and wearing Armani suits."
<p>


<strong>Riker and Picard, together - horrified</strong> "Lawyers!!"
<p>


<strong>Geordi</strong> "It can't be. All the Lawyers were rounded up
and sent hurtling into the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening."
<p>


<strong>Data</strong> "True, but appearently some must have survived."
<p>


<strong>Riker</strong> "They have surrounded the Borg ship and are
covering it with all types of papers."
<p>


<strong>Data</strong> "I believe that is known in ancient venacular as
`red tape'.  It often proves fatal."
<p>


<strong>Riker</strong> "They're tearing the Borg to pieces!"
<p>


<strong>Picard</strong> "Turn the monitors off, Data, I can't bear to
watch. Even the <a href="borg.au">Borg</a> don't deserve such a
gruesome death!" <p>
