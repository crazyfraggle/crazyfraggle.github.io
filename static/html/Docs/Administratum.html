    <h1 align="center">New chemical Element Discovered</h1>
    <p class="text">
      The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by
      investigators at a major U.S. research university. The element,
      tentatively named administratium, has no protons or electrons and thus has
      an atomic number of 0. However, it does have one neutron, 125 assistant
      neutrons, 75 vice neutrons and 111 assistant vice neutrons, which gives it
      an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by a force
      that involves the continuous exchange of meson-like particles called
      morons.

      Since it has no electrons, administratium is inert. However, it can be
      detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with.
      According to the discoverers, a minute amount of administratium causes one
      reaction to take over four days to complete when it would have normally
      occurred in less than a second.

    <p class="text">
      Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years, at
      which time it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in
      which assistant neutrons, vice neutrons and assistant vice neutrons
      exchange places. Some studies have shown that the atomic mass actually
      increases after each reorganization.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Research at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs
      naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points
      such as government agencies, large corporations, and universities. It can
      usually be found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained
      buildings.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level
      of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reaction where it
      is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how
      administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but
      results to date are not promising.
