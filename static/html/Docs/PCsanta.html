    <p class="poem">
      'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...<br />
      How to live in a world that's politically correct?<br />
      His workers no longer would answer to "Elves",<br />
      "Vertically Challenged" they were calling themselves.<br />
      And labor conditions at the north pole<br />
      Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.<br />
      Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,<br />
      Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.<br />
      And equal employment had made it quite clear<br />
      That Santa had better not use just reindeer.<br />
      So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,<br />
      Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!<br />
      The runners had been removed from his sleigh;<br />
      The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.<br />
      And people had started to call for the cops<br />
      When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.<br />
      Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.<br />
      His fur trimmed red suit was called "Unenlightened."<br />
      And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,<br />
      Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose<br />
      And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,<br />
      Demanding millions in over-due compensation.<br />
      So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,<br />
      Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,<br />
      Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,<br />
      Demanding from now on her title was Ms.<br />
      And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion<br />
      That making a choice could cause so much commotion.<br />
      Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,<br />
      Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.<br />
      Nothing that might be construed to pollute.<br />
      Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.<br />
      Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.<br />
      Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.<br />
      Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.<br />
      Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.<br />
      No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.<br />
      Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.<br />
      And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,<br />
      Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.<br />
      For they raised the hackles of those psychological<br />
      Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.<br />
      No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;<br />
      Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.<br />
      Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;<br />
      And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.<br />
      So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed;<br />
      He just could not figure out what to do next.<br />
      He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,<br />
      But you've got to be careful with that word today.<br />
      His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;<br />
      Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.<br />
      Something special was needed, a gift that he might<br />
      Give to all without angering the left or the right.<br />
      A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,<br />
      Each group of people, every religion;<br />
      Every ethnicity, every hue,<br />
      Everyone, everywhere...even you.<br />
      So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...<br />
      "May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth."
