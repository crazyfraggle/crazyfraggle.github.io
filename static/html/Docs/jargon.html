    <h1 align="center">Hacking Through the Jargon Jungle</h1>
    <p class="text">
      When I went to college in the 1980's, I heard a lot of words like "data
      input" and "beta version." They confused me. I wanted desperately to know
      what people were talking about, what Big Secret resided in the computer
      industry.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Now that I've worked in a computer company for the last few years, I've
      gained an insider's perspective. I decided to share my knowledge with the
      uninitiated by creating the following brief, handy glossary:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>ALPHA</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Software undergoes alpha testing as a first step in getting user
        feedback. Alpha is Latin for "doesn't work."
      </dd>
      <dt>BETA</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Software undergoes beta testing shortly before it's released. Beta is
        Latin for "still doesn't work."
      </dd>
      <dt>COMPUTER</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Instrument of torture. The first computer was invented by Roger "Duffy"
        Billingsly, a British scientist. In a plot to overthrow Adolf Hitler,
        Duffy disguised himself as a German ally and offered his invention as a
        gift to the surly dictator. The plot worked. On April 8, 1945, Adolf
        became so enraged at the "Incompatible File Format" error message that
        he shot himself. The war ended soon after Hitler's death, and Duffy
        began working for IBM.
      </dd>
      <dt>CPU</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Central propulsion unit. The CPU is the computer's engine. It consists
        of a hard drive, an interface card and a tiny spinning wheel that's
        powered by a running rodent - a gerbil if the machine is a 286, a rat if
        it's a 386, a ferret if it's a 486 and a ferret on speed if it's a
        Pentium.
      </dd>
      <dt>DEFAULT DIRECTORY</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Black hole. Default directory is where all files that you need disappear
        to.
      </dd>
      <dt>ERROR MESSAGE</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Terse, baffling remark used by programmers to place blame on users for
        the program's shortcomings.
      </dd>
      <dt>FILE</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        A document that has been saved with an unidentifiable name. It helps to
        think of a file as something stored in a file cabinet - except when you
        try to remove the file, the cabinet gives you an electric shock and
        tells you the file format is unknown.
      </dd>
      <dt>HARDWARE</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Collective term for any computer-related object that can be kicked or
        battered.
      </dd>
      <dt>HELP</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        The feature that assists in generating more questions. When the help
        feature is used correctly, users are able to navigate through a series
        of Help screens and end up where they started from without learning
        anything.
      </dd>
      <dt>INPUT/OUTPUT</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Information is input from the keyboard as intelligible data and output
        to the printer as unrecognizable junk.
      </dd>
      <dt>INTERIM RELEASE</dt>
      <dd class="justify">A programmer's feeble attempt at repentance.</dd>
      <dt>MEMORY</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Of computer components, the most generous in terms of variety, and the
        skimpiest in terms of quantity.
      </dd>
      <dt>PRINTER</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        A joke in poor taste. A printer consists of three main parts: the case,
        the jammed paper tray and the blinking red light.
      </dd>
      <dt>PROGRAMMERS</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Computer avengers. Once members of that group of high school nerds who
        wore tape on their glasses, played Dungeons and Dragons, and memorized
        Star Trek episodes; now millionaires who create "user-friendly" software
        to get revenge on whoever gave them noogies.
      </dd>
      <dt>REFERENCE MANUAL</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Object that raises the monitor to eye level. Also used to compensate for
        that short table leg.
      </dd>
      <dt>SCHEDULED RELEASE DATE</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        A carefully calculated date determined by estimating the actual shipping
        date and subtracting six months from it.
      </dd>
      <dt>USER-FRIENDLY</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Of or pertaining to any feature, device or concept that makes perfect
        sense to a programmer.
      </dd>
      <dt>USERS</dt>
      <dd class="justify">
        Collective term for those who stare vacantly at a monitor. Users are
        divided into three types: novice, intermediate and expert.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Novice Users. People who are afraid that simply pressing a key might
            break their computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intermediate Users. People who don't know how to fix their computer
            after they've just pressed a key that broke it.
          </li>
          <li>Expert Users. People who break other people's computers.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
