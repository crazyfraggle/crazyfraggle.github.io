<h1 align=center>1994's Most Bizarre Suicide</h1>
<p class=text>At the 1994 annual awards dinner given by the American Association for 
Forensic Science, AAFS president Don Harper Mills astounded his audience in 
San Diego with the legal complications of a bizarre death. Here is the story:
</p>

<p class=text>On 23 March 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and 
concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. The decedent had 
jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide (he left 
a note indicating his despondency). As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was 
interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window, which killed him instantly. 
Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been 
erected at the eighth floor level to protect some window washers and that Opus 
would not have been able to complete his suicide anyway because of this.
</p>

<p class=text>Ordinarily, Dr. Mills continued, a person who sets out to commit suicide 
ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended. 
That Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below probably 
would not have changed his mode of death from suicide to homicide. But the 
fact that his suicidal intent would not have been successful caused the medical 
examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands. The room on the ninth 
floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by and elderly man and 
his wife. They were arguing and he was threatening her with the shotgun. He 
was so upset that, when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife and 
pellets went through the window striking Opus. When one intends to kill subject 
A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B.
</p>

<p class=text>When confronted with this charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant 
that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. The old man said it was his long 
standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no 
intention to murder her - therefore, the killing of Opus appeared to be an 
accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.
</p>

<p class=text>The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son 
loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal incident. It 
transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, 
knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the 
gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. The case now 
becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.
</p>

<p class=text>There was an exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son, one 
Ronald Opus, had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his 
attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten story 
building on March 23, only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a ninth story 
window.
</p>
<p class=text>The medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.</p>

Your story at
http://www.cs.uit.no/~frankrl/Docs/suicide.html
 is false.

My friend Bill researched it and found that originally it was a story 
invented and told at a conference to illustrate points of law. The events 
never happened.

Someone else apparently also researched it and created a website that 
shows the origin of the "bizarre suicide" urban legend:
