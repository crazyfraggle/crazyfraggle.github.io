      <dd>
        You get in the car and drive to the store very slowly, because attached
        to the back of the car is a freight train.
      </dd>
      <dt><font color="#ff0000" size="+1">Macintosh System 7</font></dt>
      <dd>
        You get in the car to go to the store. The car drives you to church
        instead, because the store has mysteriously exploded.
      </dd>
      <dt><font color="#ff0000" size="+1">UNIX</font></dt>
      <dd>
        You get in the car and type GREP STORE. You screech off at 200 miles per
        hour and arrive at the barber shop.
      </dd>
      <dt><font color="#ff0000" size="+1">Windows NT</font></dt>
      <dd>
        You get in the car and write a letter that says "go to the store." Then
        you get out of the car and mail the letter to your dashboard.
      </dd>

        You walk to the store with Ricardo Montalban, who tells you how
        wonderful it will be when he can fly you to the store in his Learjet.
      </dd>
      <dt><font color="#ff0000" size="+1">Amiga</font></dt>
      <dd>
        You get in the car and tell it to go to the store. It takes you to a
        shopping mall on the Moon.
      </dd>
      <dt><font color="#ff0000" size="+1">Apple</font></dt>
      <dd>
        As you set out for the store, a hurricane comes up. The streets flood
        and the windshield wipers quit. You wash up in front of a store on a
        desert island in the South Pacific.
      </dd>
      <dt><font color="#ff0000" size="+1">VAX</font></dt>
      <dd>
        You get in the car and find that the controls are all labeled in
        Egyptian hieroglyphics. You press several buttons at random and suddenly
        find yourself parked in front of a store, next to an Apple.

      <dd>
        After fueling up with 6,000 gallons of gas, you get in the car and drive
        to the store with a motorcycle escort and a marching band in procession.
        Halfway there, the car blows up, killing you and half the town.

        <font color="#ff0000" size="+1">S/36 SSP [mainframe, obviously]</font>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        You get in the car and drive to the store. Halfway there you run out of
        gas. While walking the rest of the way, you are run over by kids on
        mopeds.
      </dd>
      <dt><font color="#ff0000" size="+1">AS/400</font></dt>
      <dd>
        An attendant locks you into the car and then drives you to the store,
        where you get to watch everybody else buy filet mignons.
