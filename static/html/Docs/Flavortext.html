<h1 align=center>Proposal for FlavorText Standard</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p class=text>
This RFC introduces a proposal for the new FlavorText standard, 
centering on FlavorText
Markup Language. Because of the proliferation of ChemoTranmision 
Input-Output Devices
(CTIOD) the use of smells and tastes has expanded expondentialy. When 
CTIODs were
expensive and painfully intrusive instruments, there was little need for 
standardization. Now that
almost every new home computer comes with one, the time has come to 
create a recognized way
to interface them. OlfactoryNet has done a great deal of research into 
the use of smells, so this
RFC will concentrate on the less developed World Wide Tongue.
</p>
<h2>2. The Overall Scheme for Incorperating Tastes</h2>
<p class=text>
Tastes will be accesible either through a FlavorText Transfer Protocal 
(FTTP) or through the use
of another application that supports Sweet/Sour/Bitter/Salty (SSBS) 
codes, such as a FlavorText
reader. In this case it will be up to individual uses to formalize the 
representation of SSBS, but in
this RFC the FlavorText Markup Language (FTML) will be discused. Also, 
detailed technical
notes will be included for FTTP.
</p>
<h2>3. FlavorText Transfer Protocal</h2>
<p class=text>
There will be a FlavorText Transfer Protocal Daemon listening on tcp 
port 40. This FTTPD will
handle the appropriat connections and transer of Flavor Text. Upon 
connection the FTTP client
will send a string using the following format:
</p>
<pre>
     FTTP=V.1.0
     DATE=FEB-30-97
     HOST=foo.bar.edu
     REQUEST=fttp://wwt.server.org/filename.ftml
     BROWSER=MozzarellaV.3.14159
     PLEA=PRETTY-PLEASE
</pre>
<p class=text>
The FTTPD will then return the requested ftml file, assuming that there 
is one and that the browser
given supports the tastes in it. Besides ftml files, FTTP will be able 
to access other files as well.
The file will be returned using the following format:
</p>
<pre>
     BEGIN FTTP...
     (ftml goes here)
     ...END FTTP
</pre>
<p class=text>
Future versions will include the ability to REQUEST multiple ftml files 
at once.
</p>
<h2>4. Sweet/Sour/Bitter/Salty Codes</h2>
<p class=text>
In order to allow FlavorText and the use of CTIODs to remain as open as 
possible this RFC will
deal only partialy with specific uses. Because of the need for one set 
way to refer to certain, if
crude, tastes, this RCF puts forth a proposal for SSBS codes. By giving 
each of the four basic
tastes a hexidecimal value from 0 to ff (1 to 256 in decimal) most 
simple tastes can be created. For
more complex tastes formats such as Flavor Mapped (.FMP) or Joint 
Culinary Expert Group
(.JCEG) are needed. These are discussed in more detail in RCF 2718.
</p>
<p class=text>
The general format for a SSBS code will be a string of 16 characters, 
such as #efa90017. In this
case we have referenced a taste close to a sweet-n-sour sauce. It can be 
broken down into ef a9
00 17. It is ef/ff (239/256) sweet, a9/ff (169/256) sour, not at all 
bitter and 17/359 salty. Of
course, this is only an aproximation of sweet-n-sour sauce, but it is 
much easier to use and transfer
than a full blown .FMP file.
</p>
<h2>5. FlavorText Markup Language</h2>
<p class=text>
Because of the utter lack of a standard format for referencing tastes, 
this RCF outlines a
FlavorText Markup Language here. While what is given will provide an 
adequate begining, future
versions will include more substance.
</p>
<p class=text>
Ftml uses tags, consisting of angle brackets surronding the tag, with 
optional tagmeat, such as
&lt;TAG TAGMEAT&gt;. Any tag that affects a range of text is closed with 
&lt;/TAG&gt;. While ftml is not
case sensative, the tagmeat is usualy written in caps for readability 
purposes. A ftml file consists of
two major fields: &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt;. The &lt;HEAD&gt; field simply gives the 
name of the page,
and has little to do with FTTP. Inside the &lt;BODY&gt; is the plain- and 
FlavorText of the page.
</p>
<p class=text>

Flavors are referenced in a ftml page using either SSBS codes or a FTTP 
link. Both versions can
be used for the background, text or inline tastes. In the case of 
background flavors the taste must
be defined in the tagmeat of the &lt;BODY&gt; tag. Also, the default (if any) 
flavor for text goes inside
the the &lt;BODY&gt; tag. Specific text flavors and inline tastes go inside 
the &lt;BODY&gt; field.
</p>
<p class=text>

The &lt;BODY&gt; tag is versatile enough to allow either SSBS codes or more 
advanced flavor
mapped files. In the case of the later it tiles the file for the 
background. An average page might
have a &lt;BODY BGTASTE="#efa90017" 
TEXT="fttp://wwt.foo.bar/tastes/meatloaf.fmp"&gt; or
&lt;BODY BGTASTE="sweet_and_sour.jceg" TEXT="#2a00c401"&gt; as the tag. Inside 
the BODY
tag, BGTASTE and TEXT can be used to change the background and text 
flavors, respectively.
Note that they can reference SSBS codes, local files or even remote 
files by FTTP.
</p>
<p class=text>

Inside the &lt;BODY&gt; field there are two ways to use flavor: text and 
inline tastes. To change text
from the default flavor (if any) given in the &lt;BODY&gt; tag, the &lt;FONT&gt; tag 
is used, as in &lt;FONT
FLAVOR="#efa90017"&gt;text&lt;/FONT&gt;. This is the standard way for SSBS codes, 
but to
reference a flavor mapped file either localy or on a remote machine, one 
must include a FlavorText
link, such as &lt;A 
FRC="fttp://wwt.foo.bar/tastes/mashpotato.jceg"&gt;text&lt;/A&gt;. Inline tastes 
are
easier in that they don't make a difference between SSBS codes and 
flavor mapped files. Their tag
is a simple &lt;FLV SRC="#ef19oo17"&gt; or &lt;FLV
SRC="fttp://wwt.foo.bar/tastes/jonestown_grape_koolaid.fmp"&gt;
</p>
<p class=text>

While this has been as brief overview of ftml, it contains enough basics 
to allow the use and growth
of it.
</p>
<h2>6. Security Concerns</h2>
<p class=text>
Security concerns are not addressed in this document.
</p>
<h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
<p class=text>
Hopefully this RFC has set up the framework for the use of FlavorText 
and CLIODs in general.
