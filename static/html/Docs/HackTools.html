    <p class="text">
      In addition to a common mode of dress, there is a similar set of tool of
      the trade which many hackers can be found carrying. Often a black satchel
      (though many responses claimed green, no doubt in keeping with the hiking
      boots and chamois shirts) or military surplus shoulder bag is filled to
      overflowing with things which hackers must have to sustain their hacking
      lives when separated from their computers. A typical inventory might look
      like this:
    </p>
    <ul class="justify">
      <li>Notepad (legal or steno size)</li>
      <li>Multiple pens and pencils</li>
      <li>
        Various screwdrivers, hex keys, and torx drivers (for installing cards,
        and opening cases)
      </li>

      <li>
        The flashiest programmable calculator that the person could find. These
        tend towards the HP {RPN} units, but there is a substantive minority
        using Casio algebraic units. These should graph if at all possible.
      </li>

      <li>
        Floppy disks. A variety of floppies containing diagnositc tools, a
        current project being moved to a new machine, or the most recently
        aquired programs to be toyed with.
      </li>

      <li>
        {Cruft}, and lots of it. ATM receipts, old tests, source code print
        outs, unpaid bills, scraps of note paper with program ideas, {IP}
        numbers, and phone numbers on them, etc...
      </li>

      <li>
        A good pocket knife. Swiss Army-type knives with several tools are
        prevalent.
      </li>

      <li>
        Musical instrument. Harmonicas dominate this catagorie, though DoN
        Nichols (dnichols@ceilidh.beartrack.com) apparently sports a penny
        whistle in his toolbelt.
      </li>

      <li>Multitester and/or logic probe.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text">
      More financialy equiped hackers can also be found with portable computers,
      Apple Newtons or other {PDA} devices, and expensive versions of the
      multitester (Fluke, is an example of this). A properly equipped hacker can
      continue to be immersed in a hack while sitting through an unusually
      boring lecture, or while on the bus.
