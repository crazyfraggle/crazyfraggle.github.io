    <h1 align=center>The Star Trek Drinking Game</h1>
    <dl class=justify>
      <dt>Requirements:</dt>
      <dd>Episode(s) of ST:TNG<br>
        This list<br>
        People (the more the merrier)<br>
        Beverages of your choice</dd>
      <dt>Instructions:</dt>
      <dd>Simple.  Watch the show, and whenever a condition is met,
              take the appropriate number of drinks.  The definition of
              "drink" should be decided before game play starts.  Usually,
              a good mouthful will suffice.  Optional rules are included
              at the end of the list for fun variations on the "standard"
              game.</dd>

      <dt>Compiler's Note:</dt>
      <dd>I would advise taking some time before game play starts
                 to decide which conditions to use and which to ignore.
                 Remember that this list is canonical, so you probably will
                 <b>not</b> want to use them all (especially with a new episode,
                 since you'll spend all your time reading the list, rather
                 than watching).  Please send any corrections, suggestions,
                 requests, submissions, flames, etc. to the address listed
                 above.</dd>
