      Howdy. Here's a column I wrote for the Fresno Bee on the oversaturation of
      Windows 95. If you like it, pass it around.

      There was a knock on the door. It was the man from Microsoft.
    </p>
    <p class="text">"Not you again," I said.</p>
    <p class="text">
      "Sorry," he said, a little sheepishly. "I guess you know why I'm here."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Indeed I did. Microsoft's $300 million campaign to promote the Windows 95
      operating system was meant to be universally effective, to convince every
      human being on the planet that Windows 95 was an essential, some would say
      integral, part of living. Problem was, not everyone had bought it.
      Specifically, I hadn't bought it. I was the Last Human Being Without
      Windows 95. And now this little man from Microsoft was at my door, and he
      wouldn't take no for an answer.
    </p>
    <p class="text">"No," I said.</p>
    <p class="text">
      "You know I can't take that," he said, pulling out a copy of Windows 95
      from a briefcase. "Come on. Just one copy. That's all we ask."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Not interested." I said. "Look, isn't there someone else you can go
      bother for a while? There's got to be someone else on the planet who
      doesn't have a copy."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Well, no," The Microsoft man said. "You're the only one."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "You can't be serious. Not everyone on the planet has a computer," I said.
      "Hell, not everyone on the planet has a PC! Some people own Macintoshes,
      which run their own operating system. And some people who have PCs run
      OS/2, though I hear that's just a rumor. In short, there are some people
      who just have no use for Windows 95."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The Microsoft man look perplexed. "I'm missing your point," he said.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Use!" I screamed. "Use! Use! Use! Why BUY it, if you can't USE it?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Well, I don't know anything about this 'use' thing you're going on
      about," The Microsoft man said. "All I know is that according to our
      records, everyone else on the planet has a copy."
    </p>
    <p class="text">"People without computers?"</p>
    <p class="text">"Got 'em."</p>
    <p class="text">"Amazonian Indians?"</p>
    <p class="text">"We had to get some malaria shots to go in, but yes."</p>
    <p class="text">"The Amish."</p>
    <p class="text">"Check."</p>
    <p class="text">
      "Oh, come on," I said. "They don't even wear BUTTONS. How did you get them
      to buy a computer operating system?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "We told them there were actually 95 very small windows in the box," the
      Microsoft man admitted. "We sort of lied. Which means we are all going to
      Hell, every single employee of Microsoft." He was somber for a minute, but
      then perked right up. "But that's not the point!" he said. "The point is,
      EVERYONE has a copy. Except you."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "So what?" I said. "If everyone else jumped off a cliff, would you expect
      me to do it, too?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">"If we spent $300 million advertising it? Absolutely."</p>
    <p class="text">"No."</p>
    <p class="text">
      "Jeez, back to that again," the Microsoft man said. "Hey. I'll tell you
      what. I'll GIVE you a copy. For free. Just take it and install it on your
      computer." He waved the box in front of me.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "No," I said again. "No offense, pal. But I don't need it. And frankly,
      your whole advertising blitz has sort of offended me. I mean, it's a
      computer operating system! Great. Fine. Swell. Whatever. But you guys are
      advertising it like it creates world peace or something."
    </p>
    <p class="text">"It did."</p>
    <p class="text">"Pardon?"</p>
    <p class="text">
      "World peace. It was part of the original design. Really. One button
      access. Click on it, poof, end to strife and hunger. Simple."
    </p>
    <p class="text">"So what happened?"</p>
    <p class="text">
      "Well, you know," he said. "It took up a lot of space on the hard drive.
      We had to decide between it or the Microsoft Network. Anyway, we couldn't
      figure out how to make a profit off of world peace."
    </p>
    <p class="text">"Go away," I said.</p>
    <p class="text">"I can't," he said. "I'll be killed if I fail."</p>
    <p class="text">"You have got to be kidding," I said.</p>
    <p class="text">
      "Look," the Microsoft man said, "We sold this to the AMISH. The Amish!
      Right now, they're opening the boxes and figuring out they've been had.
      We'll be pitchforked if we ever step into Western Pennsyvania again. But
      we did it. So to have YOU holding out, well, it's embarassing. It's
      embarassing to the company. It's embarassing to the product. It's
      embarassing to BILL."
    </p>
    <p class="text">"Bill Gates does not care about me," I said.</p>
    <p class="text">
      "He's watching right now," the Microsoft man said. "Borrowed one of those
      military spy satellites just for the purpose. It's also got one of those
      high-powered lasers. You close that door on me, zap, I'm a pile of grey
      ash."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "He wouldn't do that," I said, "He might hit that copy of Windows 95 by
      accident."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Oh, Bill's gotten pretty good with that laser," the Microsoft man said,
      nervously. "Okay. I wasn't supposed to do this, but you leave me no
      choice. If you take this copy of Windows 95, we will reward you
      handsomely. In fact, we'll give you your own Caribbean island! How does
      Montserrat sound?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">"Terrible. There's an active volcano there."</p>
    <p class="text">"It's only a small one," the Microsoft man said.</p>
    <p class="text">
      "Look," I said, "even if you DID convince me to take that copy of Windows
      95, what would you do then? You'd have totally saturated the market. That
      would be it. No new worlds to conquer. What would you do then?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">The Microsoft man held up another box and gave it to me.</p>
    <p class="text">"'Windows 95....For Pets'?!?!?"</p>
    <p class="text">"There's a LOT of domestic animals out there," he said.</p>
    <p class="text">
      I shut the door quickly. There was a surprised yelp, the sound of a laser,
      and then nothing.
