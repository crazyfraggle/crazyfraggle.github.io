<li>Use lots of global variables.
<li>Give them cryptic names such as: X27, a_gcl, or Horace.
<li>Put everything in one large .h file.
<li>Implement the entire project at once.
<li>Use macros and #defines to emulate Pascal.
<li>Assume the compiler takes care of all the little details you didn't

<li>If at all possible, don't, let someone else do it.
<li>Change majors.
<li>Insert/remove blank lines at random spots, re-compile, and excecute.
<li>Throw holy water on the terminal.
<li>Dial 911 and scream.
<li>There is rumour that "printf" is usefull, but this is probably
   unfounded. 
<li>Port everything to CP/M.
<li>If it still doesn't work, re-write it in assembler.  This won't fix
   the bug, but it will make sure no one else finds it and makes you
   look bad.
