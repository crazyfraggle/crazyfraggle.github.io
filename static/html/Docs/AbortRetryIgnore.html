      This is a Poem based on Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven" and it's about the
      terrors of the MSDOS' "A)bort R)etry I)gnore?"

    <h1 align="center">Abort, Retry, Ignore?</h1>
    <p class="poem">
      Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary,<br />
      System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor,<br />
      Longing for the warmth of bedsheets,<br />
      Still I sat there, doing spreadsheets:<br />
      Having reached the bottom line,<br />
      I took a floppy from the drawer.<br />
      Typing with a steady hand, I then invoked the SAVE command<br />
      But got instead a reprimand: it read "Abort, Retry, Ignore".<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      Was this some occult illusion? Some maniacal intrusion?<br />
      These were choices Solomon himself had never faced before.<br />
      Carefully, I weighed my options.<br />
      These three seemed to be the top ones.<br />
      Clearly, I must now adopt one -<br />
      Choose : "Abort, Retry, Ignore".<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      With my fingers pale and trembling,<br />
      Slowly toward the keyboard bending,<br />
      Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,<br />
      Praying for some guarantee<br />
      Finally I pressed a key --<br />
      But on the screen what did I see?<br />
      Again: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      I tried to catch the chips off-guard,<br />
      I pressed again, but twice as hard.<br />
      Luck was just not in the cards,<br />
      I saw what I had seen before.<br />
      Now I typed in desperation,<br />
      Trying random combinations.<br />
      Still there came the incantation -<br />
      Choose: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted;<br />
      Getting up, I turned away and paced across the office floor.<br />
      And then I saw an awful sight,<br />
      A bold and blinding flash of light,<br />
      A lightning bolt that cut the night and shook me to my very core.<br />
      The PC screen collapsed and died,<br />
      "Oh no -- my database", I cried.<br />
      I thought I heard a voice reply,<br />
      "You'll see your data-- Nevermore!"<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poem">
      To this day I do not know<br />
      The place to which our data goes<br />
      Perhaps it goes to Heaven where the angels have it stored.<br />
      But as for productivity - well,<br />
      I fear it has gone straight to Hell.<br />
      And that's the tale I have to tell -<br />
      Your choice: "Abort, Retry, Ignore".<br />
