      The story so far... Zaphod Beeblebrox has been quietly relaxing over a cup
      of tea while debugging his latest "Trojan megadonkey" program, when in
      burst two Galactic Securicops. These accidentally cause a nearby coffee
      machine to explode, transporting our heroes through a 'feature of
      space-time' to the End of the User Area itself. Our heroes awake to find
      themselves in a very bleak environment.

    <p class="text">
      "Like, this is really weird, man," said Zaphod. "It's a User Area with no
      people in at all."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Yeah. I've got a feeling about this place," said Ford Prefect. He pushed
      the buttons for SECURICUP in the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the User Area.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "SECURICUP," said the Guide. "A race of supremely nasty creatures with an
      even worse reputation than the Vogons. Ten million years of mis-evolution
      has resulted in a race known throughout the civilised world for its
      general rudeness and stupidity. Curiously there is one race that reveres
      the Securicups -- the sentient jellies of Userv III. These strange beings
      believe that Securicups are the incarnation of one they call 'The Holy
      Gorilla'. The best time to meet a Securicup is when you are just leaving
      anyway. The worst time is at a time in its life-cycle known as the
      Unattended Running, when it has delusions of its own power and greatness.
      It will demand what it regards as 'The One True Key', and will eat anyone
      it finds who does not possess this."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Who's that blue-suited character over there?" asked Arthur.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Oh shut up, monkey-man," said Zaphod. "Hey, Ford, I've just sussed it.
      This uncanny desolation is what they call Unattended Running. All users to
      be shot on sight. It's the sort of thing parents frighten their children
      with so that they go home and see them at Christmas."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "What Are You Doing In My User Area Stand Up Straight When I'm Talking To
      You I Saw You Hide That Cup You Long Haired Layabout I Shall Have To
      Report You What's Your Userid Where's Your Key Get Out," said the blue
      monster, lumbering up to our heroes.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      At that moment a glum-looking metallic being detached itself from a pile
      of debris behind the coffee machine and wandered sulkily towards them.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Hey, Marvin, talk to this creature, will you?" said Zaphod.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "I've just discovered a totally new Abend Code," said Marvin gloomily.
      "It's a bug in tsuna that nobody's been able to produce before. Even the
      CS isn't interested so I knew you wouldn't be. And now he tells me to talk
      to this creature. Me, with a project the size of the Chemistry
      Department..."
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      "Come on, Arthur!" said Ford Prefect. "The lift to the User Area isn't
      going to come today. We'll take the stairs."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Probably one of the people in Applied Biology training their monkeys to
      use the lift," puffed Arthur Dent as the two of them ran up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Don't knock it, Arthur," said Ford. "Remember that's how you Earthlings
      started, pushing branches until you came down from the trees."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Arthur was still recovering from surprise at finding that the Earth had
      not, after all, been demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass, so
      that, by the time he had thought of a suitable retort, the two of them had
      reached the User Area.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      They found Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting at two of the BBC Master terminals.
      "Hi, Ford! Oh hello, monkey-man," he said, swivelling his left head round
      from its terminal. "I was just getting ready to submit a job to find out
      the Ultimate Question. Hey, guys, we could be in the money on this one!"
      His right head turned away from the other terminal, where it was testing
      out a new Trojan Horse program, said "Hi" briefly, and went back to work.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The robot trudged up to them. "Oh hello, Marvin!" said Ford. "Nice to see
      you!"
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "I suppose you want me to reply with some pathetic sociable remark,"
      grumbled Marvin. "How about 'it looks like rain again'? Will that satisfy
      your desire for conversation?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Er..." said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "'Looks like rain' indeed. If you had a brain as large as mine you would
      have calculated that it was going to rain in 23 minutes precisely. Shall I
      go out now and prepare to start rusting?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "No, look, Marvin. I want to log on." said Ford. "Can you remember my
      password?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Here we go again," moaned the robot. "Am I likely to forget such a
      depressingly unoriginal password? While I've been talking to you I've had
      time to crack the entire password algorithm. Who do you want me to log you
      on as?"<br />
      "Oh, fordp will do," replied Ford. "Then go and get me a large
      pan-galactic gargle-blaster from the drinks machine."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Hey, Marvin!" said Zaphod. "Get a couple for me too."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "I'll have Cola," said Arthur. "It says 'Pan-galactic gargle-blasters
      unavailable. Engineer notified.'"
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Yeah, who cares what you're having, Earthman?" sneered Zaphod. "Wowie!
      This SYMA program sure is weird. It's just told me I haven't enough credit
      to submit my Ultimate Question Job. Me, the most credit-worthy guy in the
      Universe! I ask you..."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Let me try, Zaphod," said Ford. "I've probably got some credit left.
      Where's your file?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "In ~zaphodb/FORTY.TWO, Ford. Hey, here's the robot back with the drinks."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      As Marvin hobbled up, bearing 3 glasses of a liquid almost but not
      entirely unlike cola, Arthur looked up 'coffee machine' in his Hitch
      Hikers' Guide to the User Area.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "coffee machine. A branch of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation (formerly
      IBM) (q.v). Manufacturers of narcotic drinks. It is said that one cup of
      coffee contains enough energy to power a computer programmer for 6 hours.
      It also contains a drug known as tsunain, which causes compulsive worship
      of something known as 'the blessed machine'.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      So effective has coffee machine drink been in producing a religious
      devotion to Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Mainframes that Oolon
      Colluphid, in his latest book 'Why doesn't God go and boil his head then?'
      has argued that, if God existed, he would have invented a tea machine.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Machine coffee is not to be confused with Real Coffee (q.v.), a drink made
      on primitive planets using beans."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Hey, Marvin," said Zaphod. "Look at this SYMA output. Doesn't it blow
      your mind? What does it mean?"
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Marvin groaned in a resigned way and stared at the table of random numbers
      on Zaphod Beeblebrox's screen. "Can't stand SYMA output," he said finally.
      "Correlation coefficient with reality is minus 0.3. Leave it alone: it
      might go away."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Zaphod raised his cup to his lips, but at that moment the doors flew open
      and two uniformed men with guns trained their weapons on the party.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "O.K. Beeblebrox. We got you covered," drawled one of them. "We can see
      you got a drink at that terminal. Put the cup down and come quietly or we
      gonna shoot you."
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      "Holy Zarquon's Trojan Fish!" swore Zaphod. "It's the Securicup squad.
      They're onto us. What are we going to do, Ford?"
    </p>
