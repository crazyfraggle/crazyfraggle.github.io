      This is a bricklayer's accident report that was printed in the newsletter
      of the English equivalent of the Workers' Compensation Board. So here,
      thanks to John Sedgwick is this Bricklayer's report:
    </p>
    <h1 align="center">Dear Sir:</h1>
    <p class="text">
      I am writing in response to your request for additional information in
      Block #3 of the accident reporting form. I put "Poor Planning" as the
      cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the
      following details will be sufficient.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working
      alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I
      found I had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to
      weigh 240 lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to
      lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of
      the building at the sixth floor.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel
      out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope,
      holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240 lbs of bricks. You
      will note on the accident reporting form that my weight is 135 lbs.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my
      presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I
      proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now
      proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the
      fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in
      Section 3 of the accident reporting form.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the
      fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley which I
      mentioned in Paragraph 2 of this correspondence. Fortunately by this time
      I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the
      rope, in spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the
      ground, and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of
      the bricks, the barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to
      my weight.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent down the side of the
      building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up.
      This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe
      lacerations of my legs and lower body.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel
      seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile
      of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in
      pain, unable to move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I
      again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope.
