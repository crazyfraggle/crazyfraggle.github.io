        It can be up or down. It's more fun when it's up, but it makes it hard
        to get any real work done.
      </li>

      <li>
        In the long-distant past, its only purpose was to transmit information
        considered vital to the survival of the species. Some people still think
        that's the only thing it should be used for, but most folks today use it
        for fun most of the time.
      </li>

      <li>
        It has no conscience and no memory. Left to its own devices, it will
        just do the same damn dumb things it did before.
      </li>

      <li>
        It provides a way to interact with other people. Some people take this
        interaction very seriously, others treat it as a lark. Sometimes it's
        hard to tell what kind of person you're dealing with until it's too
        late.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you don't apply the appropriate protective measures, it can spread
        viruses.
      </li>

      <li>
        It has no brain of its own. Instead, it uses yours. If you use it too
        much, you'll find it becomes more and more difficult to think
        coherently.
      </li>

      <li>
        We attach an importance to it that is far greater than its actual size
        and influence warrant.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you're not careful what you do with it, it can get you in big
        trouble.
      </li>

      <li>
        It has its own agenda. Somehow, no matter how good your intentions, it
        will warp your behavior. Later you may ask yourself "why on earth did I
        do that?"
      </li>

      <li>
        Some folks have it, some don't.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Those who have it would be devastated if it were ever cut off. They
            think that those who don't have it are somehow inferior. They think
            it gives them power. They are wrong.
          </li>

          <li>
            Those who don't have it may agree that it's a nifty toy, but think
            it's not worth the fuss that those who do have it make about it.
            Still, many of those who don't have it would like to try it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Once you've started playing with it, it's hard to stop. Some people
        would just play with it all day if they didn't have work
      </li>
