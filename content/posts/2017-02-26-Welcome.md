## Welcome to a new attempt at blogging

My old blog has slowly obsoleted itself. This is an attempt at restarting.

### Who am I

My name is Frank Oppervoll-Larsen. I'm recently married, got two lovely kids,
and not much spare time. I live in Tromsø, Norway. Home of the midnight sun
(summer) and northern lights (winter).

I work as a software developer at Microsoft, working mostly on front end web
services and mobile apps. On my spare time, I write some more software for fun.

### What will this blog contain

Not sure. I'll attempt to blog about creating a remake of an ancient game from
my childhood. And maybe some minor insights into the world.
